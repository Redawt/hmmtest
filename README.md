# HMM
A Toy implementation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
You can view the jupyter notebook (ipython notebook) [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thjashin/hmm/blob/master/hmm.ipynb).

This implementation has following algorithms for HMM.
- Forward/Backward (sum-product)
- Viterbi (max-product)
- Baum-Welch (EM with exact E)
- Gibbs (EM with approx E)
